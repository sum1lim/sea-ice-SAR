## Getting Started

### Install the Package in a Python Virtual Environment

To avoid conflicts, the first step is to isolate this project by creating a Python virtual environment called ```venv```. The virtual environment will have it's own python interpreter, dependencies, and scripts. Commands should only be entered in a terminal that has ```venv``` active. 

#### MacOS / Linux

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install .
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Windows

```
python -m venv venv
venv/Scripts/activate
pip install .
pip install -r requirements.txt
